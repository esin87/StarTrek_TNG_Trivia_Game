# StarTrek_TNG_Trivia_Game
A trivia game for lovers of Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG). Engage!

#About This Game
Lovers of Star Trek are in good company. Self-professed fans include Barack Obama, Rihanna, and Tom Hanks. This is a trivia game consisting of ten TNG-based questions built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Star Trek: TNG is my favorite series in the Star Trek franchise, and for my first independent, from-scratch project in the General Assembly: Software-Engineering Immersive Course, I decided to honor my Trekkie side by building this game. The questions were written by me, and obviously I do not own any of the rights to Star Trek. 

#Technologies Used
The technologies used here are simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The code was passed through the HTML5 Validator and CSS validator. 

#Installation Instructions
Please download the folder titled TNG_Trivia, which contains an images folder as well as the index.html, styles.css, and script.js files that contain all of my code. Then open the index.html file in a browser (preferably Google Chrome) to play the game. 

#User Stories
My user will be able to click an "Engage!" button that will begin the game. An "about" module will appear, giving the user instructions and defining the objectives. The user will answer ten multiple choice questions about Star Trek: TNG, and accumulate points for correct answers. They will see their score progress and be given their final score at the end. The user will be able to reset the game. 

#Unsolved Problems
TBD

#Future Additions
A timer that gives the user more points for answering questions sooner. A score card that gives the user their level of Trekkieness. A larger pool of questions that are then randomly assigned each time a user plays the game.
